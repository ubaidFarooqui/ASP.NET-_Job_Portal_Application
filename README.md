# ASP.NET-_Job_Portal_Application
An application based on ASP.NET that allows the users to apply for jobs, the application contains complete CRUD operation and has strict validation controls as well, the data for posted jobs is fictitious and deployed only for learning purposes
Technically, I have used HTML and CSS for the frontend and for Backend, C# programming language is used with ASP.NET web forms along with Master Page, Microsoft SQL Server Managment Studio 2012 is used for the data storage and ADO.NET code is used for database related operation. The project is developed with Admin and Client Panel, the Admin panel can be accessed by Web owner in order to access the CVs of the candidates from the database, and can also be able to delete any user...This is just a show case project which I developed only for learning purposes and has nothing to do with the actual Job advertisment
The application is deployed on a server and can be visited at http://www.jobapp.somee.com/
